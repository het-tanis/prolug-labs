Run the u3_script1.py and look at what it shows you.

```plain
/root/u3_script.py
```{{exec}}

What are you shown?

Inspect the file and see if you can figure out what it was doing.

```plain
cat /root/u3_script.py
```{{exec}}

Note: Modify with vi or vim. Can you make this show the lowest 10 items, ordered by magnitude?

Can you generate a python script that parses the /root/users.csv file? (What resources might you use to do this?)
