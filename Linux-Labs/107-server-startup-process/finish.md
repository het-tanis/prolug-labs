Look at you, learning Linux!
You have looked at the system startup. You have looked at the systemd daemon for how processes are configured. You have looked at running software and open ports. 

This will help you to decide what you need to move forward with on your new server builds. What processes do you need to keep running and what software you want to allow are still to be determind, but you have the tools to see what currently is happening in your environment.
